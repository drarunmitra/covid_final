  abstract = {Controlling an emerging communicable disease requires prompt adoption of measures such as quarantine. Assessment of the efficacy of these measures must be rapid as well. In this paper, the authors present a framework to monitor the efficacy of control measures in real time. Bayesian estimation of the reproduction number R (mean number of cases generated by a single infectious person) during an outbreak allows them to judge rapidly whether the epidemic is under control (R \&lt; 1). Only counts and time of onset of symptoms, plus tracing information from a subset of cases, are required. Markov chain Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo sampling are used to infer the temporal pattern of R up to the last observation. The operating characteristics of the method are investigated in a simulation study of severe acute respiratory syndrome\textendash like outbreaks. In this particular setting, control measures lacking efficacy (R {$\geq$} 1.1) could be detected after 2 weeks in at least 70\% of the epidemics, with less than a 5\% probability of a wrong conclusion. When control measures are efficacious (R = 0.5), this situation may be evidenced in 68\% of the epidemics after 2 weeks and 92\% of the epidemics after 3 weeks, with less than a 5\% probability of a wrong conclusion.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been the first severe contagious disease to emerge in the 21st century. The available epidemic curves for SARS show marked differences between the affected regions with respect to the total number of cases and epidemic duration, even for those regions in which outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks.},
